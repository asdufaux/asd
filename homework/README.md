#Going onward
##Remember:
- Persistence is the most important skill a programmer can have. Talent means nothing around hour 3 of trying to find a bug.
- Getting a different error message can be progress.
- Have fun. Build something you might find useful.

###Git
- Review the [Git Cheatsheet](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/git-cheat-sheet): What do you recognize? What don't you?
- Research git branches. What do you use them for? How do you make and use a new branch?
  - Once you think you understand git branches, go to your github repository in your terminal and try to make a new branch.
  - Make some insignificant changes to your new branch.
  - Push up those changes to your new branch.
  - Now look at your repo, what changed? You should see that you can make a "pull request". Google. Once you think you get it, make the pull request and merge it with your master branch.
  - What did that do?


###Ruby
- Go through all of Learn Ruby the Hard Way. It may get boring at parts (especially when you make text adventures); persistence is key.
- Read through Chris Pine's Learn to Program. He's a funny guy, and he gets a ton of concepts down well.

###HTML/CSS
- Do [this](https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website) Codecademy lesson on HTML and CSS.
- Next, create your own [Github Page]
(https://pages.github.com/)
- Now build a website in your Github page repo that tells us a bit about you and what you're learning!
  - (Make sure not to put anything too personal on there. It is the internet after all.)
  - Make a cool entrance page ("index.html"), an "About Me", and a "Favorite Links" page.
- Just a note: CSS can be incredibly frustrating. It wasn't designed for modern websites. It was designed to format text documents (which is what the internet was for a while). But it is the standard.
  - It's easier to use what we have at the moment than to tear it apart and start fresh. It's like tearing up old roads to build all new ones.

###Typing && Terminal
- Typing and using the terminal is very important, keep going through the [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/), what do you think you'll use?
- [Sublime Shortcuts](http://www.cheatography.com/martinprins/cheat-sheets/sublime-text-3-osx/)
  - This will speed up your workflow. Get used to not using the mouse. Best advice is force yourself to run a lap, do push ups, or  put money in a jar every time you touch the trackpad.

###Miscellaneous
####This stuff isn't terribly important, but still fun to know
- Markdown! Markdown is useful when displaying docs or writing things for Github. It's what this page is written in! Some web platforms like Jekyll use them to display their content.
