#Going onward
##Remember:
- Persistence is the most important skill a programmer can have. Talent means nothing around hour 3 of trying to find a bug.
- Getting a different error message can be progress.
- Have fun. Build something you might find useful.

###Git
- Review the [Git Cheatsheet](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/git-cheat-sheet): What do you recognize? What don't you?
- Research git branches. What do you use them for? How do you make and use a new branch?
  - Once you think you understand git branches, go to your github repository in your terminal and try to make a new branch.
  - Make some insignificant changes to your new branch.
  - Push up those changes to your new branch.
  - Now look at your repo, what changed? You should see that you can make a "pull request". Google. Once you think you get it, make the pull request and merge it with your master branch.
  - What did that do?


###Ruby
- Go through all of Learn Ruby the Hard Way. It may get boring at parts (especially when you make text adventures); persistence is key.
- Read through Chris Pine's Learn to Program. He's a funny guy, and he gets a ton of concepts down well.
